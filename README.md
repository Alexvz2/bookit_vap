Study space availability based off Access Points Mac Addresses and BSSIDS

Part of Bookit Project for NWHACKS 2019

This Repository connects to the raspberry pi and runs linux commands in order to fish
the traffic in the network that its connected to and determine the number of users and approximate location
to determine density, thus estimate availability of study space.
